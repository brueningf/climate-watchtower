Goal: Build a functioning prototype of the Weather Anomaly Auditor with event-driven architecture.

Phase 1 — Backend foundation
- Initialize a Spring Boot project (Java 21, Gradle, Web, AMQP, JPA, Security).
- Create a docker-compose.yml with: RabbitMQ, TimescaleDB (Postgres), MySQL (optional).
- Implement the following modules:
  - ingestion → RabbitMQ listener to consume weather events.
  - audit → TimescaleDB repository (JPA) to store immutable JSON events.
  - processing → Simple anomaly detection logic comparing values to configured thresholds.
  - alerts → RabbitMQ producer sending anomaly messages to an alert queue.
  - results → MySQL persistence for alert summaries.
  - security → Spring Security config (JWT or Basic Auth).
- Expose REST endpoints:
  - GET /api/alerts → Retrieve stored alerts.
  - POST /api/config → Update anomaly detection thresholds.
  - (Optional) GET /api/audit → Paginated raw event view.

Phase 2 — Frontend integration
- Create a frontend/ directory with Vite + React + TailwindCSS.
- Implement pages: /dashboard, /alerts, /audit, /settings.
- Add a proxy in vite.config.js for /api/* → backend URL.
- Enable production build and static file serving by copying dist to backend.

Phase 3 — CI/CD and improvements
- Add Gradle task to build frontend automatically.
- Add GitHub Actions or similar CI to run tests, build Docker image.
- Write integration tests for event flow: Publish test event → detect anomaly → verify alert persisted.

Future Enhancements
- Rule-based anomaly detection engine with configurable thresholds.
- Real-time WebSocket push for live alert updates.
- Prometheus metrics export for monitoring.
- Grafana dashboard integration.
