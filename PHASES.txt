Goal: Build a functioning prototype of the Weather Anomaly Auditor with event-driven architecture.

Phase 1 — Backend foundation
- Initialize a Spring Boot project (Java 21, Gradle, Web, AMQP, JPA, Security). (done)
- Create a docker-compose.yml with: RabbitMQ, Timescale (Postgres). (done - docker-compose includes RabbitMQ and TimescaleDB)
- Implement modules:
  - ingestion → RabbitMQ listener to consume weather events (JSON payloads) (done)
  - audit → Timescaledb repository to store immutable JSON events (done)
  - processing → simple anomaly detection comparing values to configured thresholds
  - alerts → RabbitMQ producer sending anomaly messages to an alert queue
  - results → DB persistence for alert summaries (JPA)
  - security → Spring Security config (Basic Auth for prototype; JWT optional)
- Expose REST endpoints:
  - GET /api/alerts → Retrieve stored alerts
  - POST /api/config → Update anomaly detection thresholds
  - (Optional) GET /api/audit → Paginated raw event view

Phase 2 — Frontend integration
- Create frontend/ with Vite + React + TailwindCSS. (partial - Vite + React present; TailwindCSS not configured)
- Implement pages:
  - /dashboard — summary and live stats
  - /alerts — anomaly list and filters
  - /audit — raw event explorer
  - /settings — configuration form
- Add proxy in vite.config.js for /api/* → backend URL. (done)
- Enable production build and static file serving by copying dist to backend resources.

Phase 3 — CI/CD and improvements
- Add Gradle task to build frontend automatically and copy artifacts.
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run tests and build Docker image.
- Add integration tests for event flow: Publish test event → detect anomaly → verify alert persisted.

Future enhancements
- Rule-based anomaly detection engine with configurable thresholds
- Real-time WebSocket push for live alerts
- Prometheus metrics export and Grafana dashboards
